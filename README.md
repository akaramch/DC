The DC Deckbuilding Game is structured similarly to most deckbuilding games.
    The price is noted in the gray circle in the bottom right.
    The currency used to purchase cards is called Power, and is gained as noted on cards.
    The Line-Up where cards may be purchased holds 5 cards, and should be restocked at the end of each player's turn.
    The Kick stack holds 16 Kicks, and as many can be purchased at any time as the buyer can afford.
    Only one Supervillain may be purchased from the Supervillain stack on each person's turn. Flip the next one over at the end of turn.
     
     
    Victory Points are noted in the orange star in the bottom left of the card.
    At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins!
        The game ends when either the Super-Villain stack is empty or when the Line-Up cannot be restocked.
    
    Remember to have fun!
