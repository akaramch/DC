Supervillain needs to flip, eventually attack 

Drawing when there are no cards to be drawn - everything in play or in hand - crashes the program. I've handled this with the SVs that draw multiple cards, not sure how to handle with just regular LFRs, JQs, KFs, TFMA, etc. Should print an error message.

Cards defined in game. py do nothing--jonzz, WLPB, BartAllen, supergirl, trigon, xray vis, shazam

Nekron crashes when you destroy and then there are no more possible destroy targets - hand and discard empty. Could probably fix but I'm tired and need to check the rest of these. Fine as far as I can tell otherwise, though.




Working custom Supes (As far as I can tell, at any rate):

Arkillo
Parallax
Lex Luthor
Black Adam
H'el
Graves
