Nekron crashes when you destroy and then there are no more possible destroy targets - hand and discard empty. Could probably fix but I'm tired and need to check the rest of these. Fine as far as I can tell otherwise, though.

Nekron, Lobo, other destroy cards sometimes crash when they destroy a card from certain positions in the prompt.

Shazam is fairly susceptible to crashes
